description: A future without the 2023 Coastal Master Plan

# By the Numbers

## Ecosystems at Risk
Wetlands provide habitat, wave attenuation, and other ecosystem services that are at risk of being lost as sea level rise continues into the future.

## Wide-Ranging Impacts
Natural resources and the built environment face more challenges from coastal change in a future without the master plan projects.

## Communities at Risk
Communities are at risk of storm surge-based flooding and damages from increasingly strong hurricanes and storms in the future.
