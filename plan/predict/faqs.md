# Frequently Asked Questions

## Two different maps are shown for land change – how do I know which one is right?

The maps are based on different assumptions about the future, so neither is right nor wrong. Rather, they show us where land could be lost, where it could be built, and how much change could occur. If an area of land is lost – or built – in both maps, then we are more certain that type of change is going to occur. Both maps make assumptions about future climate and river conditions as well as how projects and structures, such as locks, are operated. If these assumptions do not play out exactly as predicted, the coastal map could be different from those presented.

## I’ve always heard about flooding from a “100 year storm”, but the master plan doesn’t use this term – why? What is used instead?

The master plan does not focus on recurrence intervals (e.g., 100-year storm), as those descriptions are based on long-term averages. As Louisianans have experienced, we can have a 100-year storm two years in a row. Instead, the maps show flood depths that have an AEP of 1% — that means every year there is a 1% chance that these flood depths will be met or exceeded. The depths and probabilities are calculated using flood depths associated with a set of storms that statistically reflect historical storm characteristics and the probability of those storms occurring in coastal Louisiana.

## The land change maps show my community at risk of significant land loss through the model period – how should I use this information?

The change shown in some areas is dramatic and is clearly concerning. Remember, however, that FWOA is used as a baseline to select restoration and risk reduction projects. Compare these maps with those shown later to see what difference the master plan can make in your area. You can use that information to advocate for construction of projects in the plan or to work with officials on other projects that could be included in future master plans to alleviate the loss and mitigate risk.
